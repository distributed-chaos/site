## üí° Best Practices

### Event Descriptions
- **Be Clear**: Explain what attendees will learn or do
- **Include Prerequisites**: Mention any required skills or knowledge
- **Set Expectations**: Describe the format (hands-on, lecture, discussion)
- **Mention Audience**: Who should attend (beginners, experts, etc.)

### Contact Information
- **Always Include**: At least one way for people to get in touch
- **Use Group Emails**: Prefer group/organization emails over personal ones
- **Include Websites**: Link to your group's main website or event page

### Location Details
- **Be Specific**: Include full addresses for in-person events
- **Test Links**: Ensure online meeting links work before submitting
- **Accessibility**: Mention if venues are wheelchair accessible
- **Parking**: Include parking information for in-person events

### Registration
- **Clear Costs**: Be upfront about any fees
- **Registration Deadlines**: Mention if there are cutoff dates
- **Capacity Limits**: Note if space is limited

## üîß Tips

1. **Use Descriptive IDs**: Make them lowercase with underscores (`dc_security_meetup`)
2. **Write Clear Descriptions**: Help people understand what to expect
3. **Include Contact Info**: Make it easy for people to get in touch
4. **Test Your YAML**: Use a YAML validator to check syntax
5. **Be Consistent**: Follow the existing patterns in the file
6. **Update Regularly**: Keep recurring event details current

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **YAML Syntax Errors**: 
   - Check indentation (use spaces, not tabs)
   - Ensure proper nesting
   - Use quotes around strings with special characters

2. **Date/Time Format**: 
   - Use YYYY-MM-DD for dates
   - Use 24-hour format (HH:MM) for times
   - Include timezone information

3. **Missing Required Fields**: 
   - Every event needs `id`, `title`, `group`, `description`
   - Recurring events need `recurrence` details
   - One-time events need `date` and `start_time`

### Validation Tools
- [YAML Validator](https://yamlchecker.com/)
- [JSON Formatter](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/)

## üÜò Getting Help

### Before Submitting
- Check existing events in `_data/events.yml` for examples
- Validate your YAML syntax online
- Test locally if possible (see Step 4 above)

### Need Assistance?
- **GitHub Issues**: Open an issue for questions or problems
- **Community Chat**: Ask in the community Discord/Slack
- **Email**: Contact the maintainers directly
- **Documentation**: Check the README.md for additional info

### Pull Request Guidelines
- **Clear Title**: Use descriptive PR titles like "Add CryptoParty Workshop"
- **Description**: Explain what event you're adding and why
- **Single Event**: One event per pull request when possible
- **Test First**: Verify your YAML is valid before submitting

## ü§ù Community Guidelines

### Event Inclusion Criteria
- **Relevant**: Events should be related to technology, security, making, or community building
- **Open**: Events should be open to community members (not private/corporate only)
- **Local**: Focus on DC metro area events, but virtual events welcome
- **Appropriate**: Follow community standards and code of conduct

### Content Standards
- **Accurate Information**: Ensure all details are correct and up-to-date
- **Professional Tone**: Use clear, professional language in descriptions
- **Inclusive Language**: Welcome all skill levels and backgrounds
- **No Spam**: Don't use the calendar for promotional content only

### Maintenance
- **Keep Updated**: Update or remove events that are cancelled or changed
- **Respond to Issues**: Be available to fix problems with your events
- **Community First**: Prioritize community benefit over self-promotion

## üìä Event Analytics

After your event is added, you can track:
- **Calendar Views**: How many people view the calendar
- **Event Clicks**: How often people click on your event
- **Registration Clicks**: Clicks through to registration links

## üéØ Success Tips

### Promote Your Event
- **Social Media**: Share the calendar link
- **Mailing Lists**: Include calendar in newsletters
- **Cross-Post**: Share in relevant communities
- **Word of Mouth**: Encourage attendees to check the calendar

### Engage the Community
- **Follow Up**: Add photos or summaries after events
- **Feedback**: Ask for suggestions on improving events
- **Collaborate**: Partner with other groups for joint events
- **Mentor**: Help newcomers add their first events
